## About
This game was made in one evening during my attempt to try out game development with inspirations from the classic [Helicopter flash game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiebMObNEi4). The scope of it is kept extremely small since it was used to practice a select few portions of game development:
* Side-scrolling camera movement
* Beginner sprite animations
* Sound effect creation (via [sfxr](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)) and implementation
* Map creation via tilesets
* Simple UI/HUD creation

As soon as I got the basic mechanics working, I spent at least a couple of hours developing carpal tunnel ensuring that the map was probably possible to beat. 

I have no intention of majorly developing this any further.

## Play
This can be played through the Godot editor. I don't have an exported copy available to download as of now. If you do choose to download the project and play through Godot, know that the game is played entirely with the mouse - left click to lift, let go to fall, and right click to start a new round. Also, there is no exit button implemented, so the game will have to be closed manually. Finally, there is no winning scene, just an end to the cave.
